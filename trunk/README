MTCA4U for EPICS
   Device support for integrating MTCA4U with EPICS
================================================================================

ABOUT
-----

The MTCA4U project provides an adapter that allows control-systems to
communicate with devices (typically MicroTCA / PCI Express devices) in a generic
way. This EPICS device support interfaces to that adapter, so that it makes it
very easy to integrate a hardware device (or rather a hardware device library)
that is based on MTCA4U into EPICS.


COMPILING
---------

Please copy configure/EXAMPLE_CONFIG_SITE.local to configure/CONFIG_SITE.local
and configure/EXAMPLE_RELEASE.local to configure/RELEASE.local and adjust the
paths in these files.

The MTCA4U EPICS device support needs the Boost C++ libraries and the MTCA4U
control-system adapter. If you compiled the MTCA4U control-system adapter, you
most likely already have all required Boost libraries.


USING THE DEVICE SUPPORT / DRIVER
---------------------------------

In order to use the device support and driver in an IOC, you have to add the
line

MTCA4U_EPICS=/path/to/mtca4u

to the configure/RELEASE file of your IOC application. Assuming your IOC 
application name is "xxx", you also have to add the two lines

xxx_DBD += mtca4u.dbd
xxx_LIBS += mtca4uEpics

to the file xxxApp/src/Makefile.

You can the use DTYP "mtca4u" for most record types. The device addresses
have the form "@deviceName processVariableName" where "deviceName" is the name
of the device that has been used when registering it with the DeviceRegistry
(see below) and "processVariableName" is the name of the process variable within
the device. Please refer to the documentation of the respective device or device
library to find out which process variables exist for a certain device.

For the waveform record, you have to use the DTYP "mtca4u input" or
"mtca4u output", depending on the direction the record should use.

You have to initialize the respective device or device library and then register
the device's ControlSystemPVManager with the mtca4u::epics::DeviceRegistry.
For example:

mtca4u::epics::DeviceRegistry::registerDevice("myDevice", controlSystemPVManager);

You can do this from the IOC's main function, but typically you will rather add
an IOC shell function for that purpose.
